<p class="text_column">Who are the top 20 NBA basketball players? Who has the greatest offense and defense game? FiveThirtyEight.com provided the data from Raptor’s Top NBA players. Using Excel spreadsheet, I did construct a web graph that displays each player's potential in offense and defense of the game, and their average as the best player. My theory is the players who have the highest offensive and pace impact are the best NBA players. Website design was created using Visual Studio and Dreamweaver. </p>
Reflection 
It was hard getting all the data into some type of chart, but the final selection came down to a web net design type of chart. I tried to fit all the data onto the chart, but I was force to only include what was necessary. The next was forming the formulas to rank from top basketball players to the less ranked basketball players. I would like a graphical interaction between the user and the web page, but that is difficult to achieve when simply using HTML and no other languages. Instead, I went with the clean appearance. Getting the page to communicate with Visual Basic and Dreamweaver was a unique challenge. It totally didn't want to accept protocols. I tried downloading the information, then I considered uploading the information. I even tried to manually input the information. Then finally I got it to take. The last challenge was adding a hyperlink to the spreadsheet data. I also noticed that some times it would take a couple of refreshes to display the page from github repositories. I never knew how to use github effectively until this assignment. I think I will leave all my future projects open source for learning and improvement. </section>
